***DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ERRORS IN INPUT***

#Brief Description
Used a stack, after parsing the input, to calculate the values. Pushed operands until an
operator was seen, then popped 2 values and did the calculation.

#Functional
no for loops other than printing
only (somewhat) global variable is the stack, otherwise everything is local
